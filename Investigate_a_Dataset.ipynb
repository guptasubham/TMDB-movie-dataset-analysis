    ">  It is seen that in the 1960s the total movies released each year is below 50, which in 1970s increased to be lesser than 100. In the 1980s the number of movie releases increased from below 100 to below 200 and that though because of the enternainment industry in this generation produced movies on nudity and sex.  In the 1990s the movie industry saw many independent directors which in tern resulted in more movies. From 2000s the entertainment industry boomed and skyrocketed from 200 movies per year to 680 movies.This came with the discovries of new age lens and camera.This boom was also supported by the tech industry which included (3D,VR,etc)."

The cast associated with high popularity movies are Robert De Niro and Bruce Willis;  director associated with high popularity movies are Steven Spielberg;  genres associated with high popularity movies are drama, comedy, and thriller;  keywords associated with high popularity movies are based on novel and dystopia;  producer associated with high popularity movies are Warner Bros., Universal Pictures and Paramount Pictures.\n",

    "<br>2.There were many zero values in the budget, revenue and runtime columns, when searched for some of the movies from this list it was found that they actually had budget ,revenue and definitely had runtimes.So it was missing values that were present there.As the total number of zero values was too many dropping them could have lead us to wrong decisions and it was replaced with numpy NaN values, so that other variables of that data could be used.\n",
    "<br>3.The runtime column had quite a few zero values and so it was dropped from the dataset.\n",
    "<br>4.There were also few null values in the cast,directors and genres column which was also dropped so that it could not affect the observations.\n",
    "<br>5.There was also one duplicate items which intern was dropped.\n",
